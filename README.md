Key Questions & Findings

1. Births to mothers under 20 have steadily declined, reflecting improved reproductive health awareness and prevention efforts.


2. Births to mothers over 40 remain low but stable, indicating late-age pregnancies exist but remain limited.


3. Total birth volumes were strongest before 2010, with moderate decline and fluctuations afterward influenced by socioeconomic factors.


4. The average maternal age of approximately 29.5 years indicates clear postponement of childbearing.

Key Insights

The highest concentration of births occurs among women in their late-20s to early-30s.

Teenage pregnancies continue to decrease markedly across observed years.

Advanced maternal-age pregnancies persist but form a small share of total births.

Total births fluctuate, signaling an ongoing demographic transition.

Recommendations

1. Strengthen maternity care programs for women aged 25–35 who represent the largest birth cohort.


2. Sustain youth reproductive education and contraception programs to prevent resurgence in teenage pregnancy.


3. Expand specialist support for mothers aged 40+ through high-risk pregnancy clinics, early screening, and enhanced monitoring pathways.


4. Investigate long-term socioeconomic drivers of fertility trends including housing affordability, workforce participation, education timelines, and migration patterns.
